# Traffic-Light-Image-Detection-and-Processing

The goal of this project is to create a fully functioning and error free implementation of a traffic light detection and image processing software. With the advent and increased popularity of self-driving cars in the world, the advancement in spatial image processing and recognition is becoming increasingly important (Othman, 2022). The increasing number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) being produces and released on to the roads has made public safety and protection ever increasingly important. Most public studies and research show that a large percentage of traffic fatalities and traffic injuries in the US occur at or near intersections (Cirincione, 2023).

The problem being tackled by this project is to create a fully functioning and accurate traffic light detection and image processing software that can be incorporated into the systems of autonomous vehicles (Avs) to increase the safety of the public and also the safety in self-driving cars. This project aims at increasing the safety of self-driving cars around intersections and traffic lights.
